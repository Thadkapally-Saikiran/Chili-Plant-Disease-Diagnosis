### ABSTRACT
Agriculture, the backbone of nations, provides essential food and raw materials. Detecting chilli plant diseases is crucial due to their impact on food security. Traditional methods, often relying on visual inspection by experts, are commonly used for identifying these diseases. This work focuses on implementing Chilli plant disease detection and classification (PDDC-Net) using deep learning. It includes preprocessing to remove noise and normalize images. The PDDC-Net uses a ResNet-CNN for feature extraction and classification.

### INTRODUCTION
 * China, with over 20% of the worldâ€™s population, faces a significant challenge due to limited arable land, which is less than 10% of its total area. Natural disasters can severely impact agricultural output, making stable agricultural development crucial for the country
 * Despite advancements in science and technology, crop yields have not significantly improved due to various natural and non-natural factors. Current research on crop diseases focuses on two main methods: traditional physical methods using spectral detection and intelligent recognition, which is challenging in mountainous areas
 *  This paper proposes developing an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for complex mountainous environments to create a model for identifying crop diseases and pests. The goal is to enhance agricultural informatization, mitigate pest and disease damage, and improve crop yields


### EXISTING SYSTEM
1. There is a system which is existing using Machine Learning(SVM).
2. It is a system which cannot work on image processing directly
3. The third party technique is used to convert image to numerical data
4. Then the Machine Learning algorithm is applied for the image processing

### Skills/ Concepts demonstrated

The following Python vs Machine Learning features were incorporated:
- Importing the required libraries i.e. Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- Reading the dataset using "Pandas"
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Understanding and Cleaning the Data
- Statistical Correlation Analysis
- Visualizing Data using Seaborn library
- Draw Insights from visual Data and conclude data driven decision upon problem-statement
- Machine Learning Model Building
   * Separating the dataset into features and target data
   * Split the data set into train and test
   * Implementing the Linear Regression Model
   * Evaluating the prediction scores.
   * Visualizing the results
   * Repeat this for remaining Models(Decision Trees, RandomForest, K-NearestNeighbour, XGBoost, Adaboost)
- Evaluating the model accuracy.
- Compare the Models Evaluation Scores, Metrics and select the best Model performence

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Focus on improving app engagement
   * Since there seems to be a strong correlation between time spent on the app and amount of money spent, you can focus on strategies to keep users engaged with the app for longer periods of time. This could include things like gamification, personalized recommendations, and exclusive offers for app users.
- Target website visitors with retargeting campaigns
  * Since time spent on the website also seems to be correlated with spending, you can target website visitors with retargeting campaigns to encourage them to make a purchase.
- Develop strategies to retain members
  * The data suggests that longer memberships lead to higher spending. You can develop strategies to retain members, such as offering loyalty programs and exclusive benefits for long-term members.
- Develop strategies to retain existing members
  *  This could include offering loyalty programs, discounts, or exclusive content to members.
- Encourage customers to sign up for memberships
  * You could offer a free trial or discount on the first year of membership.
- Target your marketing campaigns to high-value customers
  * These are the customers who are most likely to spend a lot of money on your platform.

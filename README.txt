Files and Folders Used in "DISEASE DETECTION IN CHILLI PLANTS AND REMOTE MONITORING OF AGRICULTURAL PARAMETERS" Project:
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1) run.bat: A run.bat file is a batch script used in Windows operating systems to automate repetitive tasks the execution of commands or scripts.

2) MaskDetection.py: It could potentially be a Python script or module designed to perform mask detection on images or video frames.

3) requirements.txt: It is a text file that lists the packages and their respective versions required to run a Python application. 

4) model: It is a folder appears to be a directory where the machine learning model and related data are stored. 
    i)history.pckl: In machine learning, the training history typically includes information about how the model's performance metrics (like accuracy and loss) change over each epoch    
                    (training iteration). This information is crucial for analyzing and visualizing the training process, understanding the model's behavior, and making decisions about 
                    model adjustments.        
    
    ii)model.json: In the context of machine learning and deep learning, a model.json file typically refers to a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that stores the architecture of a  
                   machine learning model.
                   The model's architecture is defined in terms of layers, connections, and parameters they are :
                   1)Layer Information: Details about each layer in the neural network, including the type of layer (e.g., dense, convolutional), the number of units/neurons, activation 
                                        functions, and any other layer-specific configurations.
                   
                   2)Connections: Information about how layers are connected, specifying which layer is connected to which, forming the complete network topology.
              
                   3)Configuration Parameters: Additional configuration settings, such as learning rate, optimizer type, loss function, and any custom metrics used during training.

                   4)Model Hyperparameters: Parameters like input shape, output shape, and any other hyperparameters that define the model's input and output dimensions.

    iii)model_weights.h5: It is a file that stores the weights (parameters) of a machine learning or deep learning model. 

    iv)X.txt.npy and Y.txt.npy: These files contain NumPy arrays serialized in a binary format.which preserves the array data efficiently and allows for fast loading and saving of large 
                                datasets.

5) ChilliDataset: This folder consists of labeled dataset for training the model.

6) testImages: This folder consists of test dataset for testing the model.
